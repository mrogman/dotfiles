# dotfiles

My collection of workstation configuration files.

**I will not be maintaining this to support other systems beyond Ubuntu and OSX at this point. Copy anything that you like, but customize your area to fit your needs.**

*Note: this is still a work in progress while I transfer my settings to my new Ubuntu box and write them to this repo*

That being said, for now, this will only be valid for Ubuntu and possibly other Debian distros, although I also intend to make it compatible with  OSX.
